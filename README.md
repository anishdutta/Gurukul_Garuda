# Gurukul App

##Inspiration
In the time of pandemic, educational institutes are spending quite a large amount of dollars for their online educational services. In such circumstances, many a times it becomes difficult for the less finiancially strong institutions to afford these services on such platforms. Hence we came up with the idea of Gurukul app which caters to all these services at a very reasonable price which anyone can afford.
